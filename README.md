* **Booking Requests:** Students can send session requests directly through the platform.
* **Q\&A Portal:** Students ask questions and get answers from tutors.
* **Review System:** Students provide feedback and rate tutors.
* **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices with Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used
